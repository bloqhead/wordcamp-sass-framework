# WordCamp Sass Framework
This is a theme framework based on [Andrew Nacin's](https://github.com/nacin)
base theme v2, which is based on [Underscores](underscores.me). It is meant
to be barebones and easy enough to make your own.

## The general goal
This theme will provide future [WordCamp](http://central.wordcamp.org/)
organizers with a theme that can easily be banged out for their needs.
It includes SCSS files that are geared towards WordCamp-specific things,
 such as attendees, tickets, sponsors, etc.

## What does this theme use?
* [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io)
* [Bourbon Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io)
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com)
* Some rad mixins/functions from [Tim Knight](https://github.com/timknight)
