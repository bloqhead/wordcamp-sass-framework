# WordCamp Sass Framework
This is a theme framework based on [Andrew Nacin's](https://github.com/nacin)
base theme v2, which is based on [Underscores](underscores.me). It is meant
to be barebones and easy enough to make your own.

## The General Goal
This theme will provide future [WordCamp](http://central.wordcamp.org/)
organizers with a theme that can easily be banged out for their needs.
It includes SCSS files that are geared towards WordCamp-specific things,
such as attendees, tickets, sponsors, etc.

## Why did you make this?
When I was working on the WordCamp Tampa website, the workflow was a bit
limited. I was provided access to the wp-admin code editor (which uses a
nice code highlighter plugin by the way) but I wanted to work locally.
So I took the existing CSS from the Underscores base v2 template, divided
it up into separate SCSS files, setup Underscores locally in MAMP and
worked from there. This theme framework is the product of that workflow
and now I'm passing it along to anyone that will benefit from it.

## What does this theme use?
* [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io)
* [Bourbon Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io)
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com)
* Some rad mixins/functions from [Tim Knight](https://github.com/timknight)
